# Scrap-Mechanic-Crafting-Mod
A neat mod that I put together that replaces some (in my opinion) useless crafting recipes for scrap mechanic survival mode that lets you craft guns for a fairly expensive but more reasonable amount and it also lets you craft all 3 levels of garment boxes

To install it 
1- navigate to you're "scrap mechanic" folder in you're steamapps folder.
2- go into the "survival" folder
3- go into the "crafting recipes" folder
4- open the file "craftbot" with notepad++
5- remove all of the code in the "craftbot" file and replace it with the code in the other file of this .zip
